To install cloc, copy either the Perl source file or executable 
to the desired installation directory.  For example, installing
the source file on Unix/Linux:

    cp cloc  /usr/local/bin/cloc


Dependencies:

cloc depends on two Perl modules, Algorithm::Diff and Regexp::Common.
If cloc cannot find these at runtime, it will install portions of
these modules embedded in the cloc source code to temporary directories, 
then delete these temporary installations after the cloc run completes.  
cloc will start more quickly if these modules are already installed on 
the target system.  These commands will tell whether or not the modules 
are installed:

  perl -MAlgorithm::Diff -e 'print "$Algorithm::Diff::VERSION\n"'
  perl -MRegexp::Common  -e 'print "$Regexp::Common::VERSION\n"'

If a version number appears, the module in question is available.

Additionally, cloc will look for the Digest::MD5 module to help
identify duplicate files.  If this module is not available, 
duplicate file checks are skipped.  To test for the existence
of Digest::MD5 use

  perl -MDigest::MD5     -e 'print "$Digest::MD5::VERSION\n"'
